4)make a subset of the feature data frame with only the mean or standar deviation

5)replace activity values in all_test_train using factor levels

6)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. replace abreviations with full description names and make some changes to optimize the performance of R (example: convert to lowercase the variable names)
